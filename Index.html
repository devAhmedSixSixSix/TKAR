			<p>Jquorie and family</p>

			<p>My name is Jquorie Kishon Alessandro Robinson (Jkar), otherwise called Quorie, Alessan, and JKAR.
				I have one sister, Jamilliah (J), and two brothers: Joleon (JoJo) and Jaxon (Jax). My parents named us,
				so we all have the same initials, "JKAR."</p>

			<p>I am presently an 8th grader. One of my goals is to attend St. Stephen and St. Agnes for High School. I
				want to be able to play sports and interact with other kids. As a home-school student for the last two
				years, returning to in-person learning will allow me to improve my social interactions and social
				appropriateness for my age group.
				I love science subjects and want to learn all about them. However, my favorite subject is Chemistry.
				Attending the prestigious Howard University, an HBCU in Washington D.C., to study Chemistry and become a
				Quantum Chemist is an objective to reaching my ultimate goal. The Ultimate goal is to help the world by
				studying atoms and molecules to understand how the world and even the universe works and improve the
				accuracy of theoretical methods.</p>

			<p>I swim for the Accokeek Stroke and Technique Swim (ASTS) team and have been a part of the ASTS team for
				three years. I've competed in various meets, including freestyle 50m, breaststroke 100m, and backstroke
				100m.
				My best time for 50m freestyle is 38.15. The cut-off time on the US Swim Association B list is 33.5s.
				Perseverance and practice will allow me to make the US Swim Association B list by the end of this
				season.

				I want to be a part of St. Stephen and St. Agnes school's swim team, with plans to work hard to become
				the
				captain. Coach Banks always inspires me to swim my best and to assist all my teammates on the swim team.
